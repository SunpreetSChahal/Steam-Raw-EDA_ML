# Steam - Analysis
## *Further Data Cleaning, EDA and Game Recommendation*

This project is my first project which leans towards *data engineering*, with empahsis on converting raw data into something that is useable and accurate. Cleaning raw data, whereas my previous projects brushed over the cleaning process.

The aim of this project is to:
- Clean data, initally in a notebook
- Transfer code to an IDE and upload a script for the data cleansing process
- Complete EDA on various topics
- Create a recommendation system for the media on Steam

This project will carry some simillar analysis from previous projects, however, the process of data cleaning will be drastically more advanced (relative to my previous work).

*...PREVIEW.csv - is a snipped version of the original dataset, original dataset has 29235 rows, instead of 50*

*(03) represents this as my 3rd personal project since joining GSK in Sept. 2021*

### How can I replicate this project to embed this knowledge?

- Collect data first-hand (data-sourcing)
- Clean that data:
1) Cleaning the raw data
2) Optimising the code from process 1.
3) Quick brief overview of the cleaned data
- Perform EDA

#### *Within the notebooks I have included a "Future reference" summary under each section*

*The purpost of this is to easily use this project as reference for any future projects, where I can transfer code/concepts*
